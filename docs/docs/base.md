# Base image

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! info
    The Docker image name for this image is `base`

Our base image updates all `apt-get` packages and installs the following
packages:

- `python3`
- `python3-pip`

Also, we create a custom user `techuser`. This user will always be used to run
the containers and allows to assign a custom `UID`. This can make sense, if you
want to deploy the containers in a K8s cluster and your company has some
security restrictions (e.g. specific `UID` ranges).

Feel free to modify this image to your specific needs. You are able to set
proxies, custom registry URLs, your timezone, CA certificates and any other
stuff.

The following environment variable can be set in all images:

- `WORKSPACE_DIR`: The directory applications (Eclipse, Capella, Jupyter) will
  use as workspace. The workspace directory shall be a subdirectory of
  `/workspace` or `/home/techuser`.

## Use the prebuilt image

```
docker run -it ghcr.io/dbinfrago/capella-dockerimages/base:$CAPELLA_DOCKER_IMAGES_REVISION
```

where `$CAPELLA_DOCKER_IMAGES_REVISION` is the tag or branch of this
repository. In case of branches, replace all characters matching the regex
`[^a-zA-Z0-9.]` with `-`.

## Build it yourself

### Build it manually with Docker

To build the base image, please run:

```zsh
docker build -t base base
```

**Important:** If your company has a specific base image with all company
configurations, of course, it can also be used:

```zsh
docker build -t base --build-arg BASE_IMAGE=$CUSTOM_IMAGE base
```

Make sure that your `$CUSTOM_IMAGE` is a Linux image that has the common tools
installed and uses the `apt` / `apt-get` package manager. If this is not the
case, the image can not be used. Our images were tested with the image
`debian:bookworm`.

If you like to set a custom `UID` for the user `techuser`, you can run:

```zsh
docker build -t base --build-arg UID=1001 base
```
