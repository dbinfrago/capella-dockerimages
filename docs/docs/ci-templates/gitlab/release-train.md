# Release train

The image builder Gitlab CI/CD template is limited to one environment and one
Capella version. In addition, we provide a release train template, which can be
used to trigger the image builder pipeline with a matrix of Capella versions
and environments.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! warning
    To continue, create a new image builder Gitlab repository and follow the instuctions of the image builder template.

The pipeline is not triggered automatically. There are a few options to trigger
the pipeline automatically:

For changes on Github in this repository (e.g., new push to branches or a new
tag):

- If you're using the PREMIUM version of Gitlab, pipelines can be automatically
  triggered for external repositories:
  https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/ci_cd_for_external_repos/
- Detect changes on the remote with `git ls-remote` and trigger a Gitlab CI
  pipeline with a cronjob.

For changes in your Gitlab image builder repository:

- Use a [Gitlab trigger](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#trigger) to
  trigger the release train pipeline.

You can customize the pipeline to your needs (e.g., define multiple
environments). The template provides three different jobs `.base`, `.capella`
and `.jupyter` which can be extended:

```yaml
include:
  - remote: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dbinfrago/capella-dockerimages/${CAPELLA_DOCKER_IMAGES_REVISION}/ci-templates/gitlab/release-train.yml"

.staging: &staging
  rules:
    # For commits on the main branch, build for the staging environment
    - if: '$CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME == "main"'
    - when: manual

    ENVIRONMENT: staging

    BUILD_FOR_LATEST_TAG: "0"

.production: &production
