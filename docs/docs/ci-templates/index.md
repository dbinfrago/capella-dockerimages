# CI/CD templates

## Gitlab CI/CD

Currently, we provide the following Gitlab CI/CD templates:

- [Export to T4C](./gitlab/t4c-export.md): Export model in repository to T4C
  using the merge strategy
- [Diagram cache](./gitlab/diagram-cache.md): Export diagrams of a Capella
  model and store them in Gitlab artifacts
- [Image builder](#image-builder): Build and push all Docker images to any
  Docker registry.
- [Model validation](#model-validation): Runs the Capella model validation CLI
  tool.

And the following Github CI/CD actions:

- [Diagram cache](./github/diagram-cache.md): Export diagrams of a Capella
  model and store them in Github artifacts, with the option to push it to a new
  branch

We offer more templates as part of our `py-capellambse` project. Please have a
