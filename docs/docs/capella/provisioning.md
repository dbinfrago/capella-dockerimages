# Load models to your workspace automatically

!!! info "Migration from `v1.X.X` to `v2.X.X` and later"

    This feature replaces the read-only image of version `v1.X.X`.
    Before starting the new image, you have to clone the Git repositories
    that you've passed to the read-only image manually. The path with all
    repositories can then be mounted to the new image as described below.

!!! info "Technical prerequisites"

    The feature relies on an Eclipse plugin that is not part of Capella.
    The plugin is called `models-from-directory-importer` and is available
    on GitHub: https://github.com/dbinfrago/capella-addons.

    The plugin is part of all Capella based pre-built images on GitHub.
    If you build it manually, make sure that you follow the ["Install dropins" instructions](./base.md#install-dropins).

To load models to your workspace automatically, you can mount a volume to the
container.

```
docker run -d \
    -v path/to/models/on/host:/models \
    -e ECLIPSE_PROJECTS_TO_LOAD='[]' \
    capella/base
```

The `ECLIPSE_PROJECTS_TO_LOAD` environment variable is a JSON array that
contains:

```json
[
  {
    "revision": "master", // (1)
    "nature": "project", // (2)
    "path": "/models/directory", // (3)
    "entrypoint": "test.aird" // (4)
  }
]
```

1. The revision of the Eclipse project. In case of duplicated project names,
   the revision is added as suffix to the project name.
2. Optional: Can be either 'project' or 'library'. Defaults to 'project'.
   Ignored if the the directory provided in the `path` attribute contains a
   `.project` file.
3. Path to the directory where the project should be loaded from.
4. Path to the aird file, starting from the directory provided in the `path`
   attribute. Required if the `.aird` is not placed directly in the directory
   provided as `path`. If None, the aird is searched in the path directory
   without recursion.

All additional attributes are ignored.

You can use all images that are based on the `capella/base` image for this
feature.
